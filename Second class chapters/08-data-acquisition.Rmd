# Data Acquisition 

There are many ways to acquire sports data to analyze in R. These include:

- Manually typing data into a spreadsheet
- Downloading pre-formatted tabular data from [(https://www.sports-reference.com/)](https://www.sports-reference.com/)
- Downloading datasets from various internet sources
- Importing data using R libraries
- Scraping data from internet websites

This chapter will explore these various methods of acquiring data and will also review data visualization and summaries. We will typically use `ggplot` for visualization and `kable` for data tables. [The R Graph Gallery (http://r-graph-gallery.com/)](http://r-graph-gallery.com/) is a nice resource for visualizations using `ggplot`.

## Tabular Data From Sports Reference

All tabular data on [Sports Reference (https://www.sports-reference.com/)](https://www.sports-reference.com/) can be easily downloaded though a little bit of data wrangling and cleaning is required to prepare the data.

Once you have navigated to the page that you want to download data from, click **Share & Export**, and select **Get table as CSV (for Excel)**. This will generate comma-separated data that you can copy and paste into your favorite text editor. 

![Get table in CSV format](images/sports-ref-csv.png){width=40%}

![Copy data and save as .csv](images/sports-ref-csv2.png){width=80%}

:::{.example}
Acquire the **Scoring Regular Season** dataset for the Colorado Avalanche 2021--2022 season.

This data is located on this webpage:
[https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/2022.html](https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/2022.html).

Once the data has been collected, using data wrangling and cleaning methods to transform the dataset into an easier to use format. Use this dataset to explore the relationship between goals, assists, OPS (offensive point shares), and DPS (defensive point shares).

## Downloading Datasets From Internet

We can directly download datasets from the internet if we have a valid url to the datset.

:::{.example}
Game-by-game data for the CSU volleyball team is available at: [https://aaron-nielsen.github.io/csu_volleyball.csv](https://aaron-nielsen.github.io/csu_volleyball.csv)

Download this data and create some visualizations.
:::

```{r}
# Load data from URL
url <- "https://aaron-nielsen.github.io/csu_volleyball.csv"
csu_vb = read_csv(url,show_col_types = F)

# Look at first ten rows and columns
csu_vb %>% select(1:10) %>% slice(1:10) %>% kable(booktabs=T)
```

## Importing Data Using R Libraries

### BaseballR package

The `baseballr` package allows for scraping data from Baseball Reference, Fangraphs, and Baseball Savant.

For more information, visit: [https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/)

:::{.example}
Use the `baseballr` package to obtain game results for the Colorado Rockies in 2022. Create a Kable Table of the first 20 games.
:::

```{r,cache=T}
library(baseballr)

# Scrape data from Baseball Reference
rox22 <- bref_team_results("COL", 2022)

# Select relevant columns and display first 20 games
rox22 %>% 
  select(Date,H_A,Opp,Result,R,RA,Time,Attendance) %>% 
  slice(1:20) %>% kable(booktabs=T)
```

\newpage

:::{.example}
Use the `baseballr` packges to obtain the batting leaderboards for MLB in 2022. Create a table with the top ten players in terms of WAR.
:::

```{r,cache=T}
# Scrape data from Fangraphs
# bat22 <- fg_batter_leaders(x = 2022, y = 2022)
# 
# # Select relevant columns
# bat22 = bat22 %>% 
#   select(Name,Team,OPS,WPA,wRC,WAR)
# 
# # Arrange by leaders in WAR and print to a Kable table
# bat22 %>% 
#   arrange(desc(WAR)) %>% 
#   slice(1:10) %>% 
#   kable(booktabs=T)
```

\newpage

:::{.example}
Using the `baseballr` package, obtain the top ten leaders for max hit speed along with these players average hit speed, number of barrels, and barrel percent. Present this information in a Kable table.
:::

```{r, cache=T}
# Scrape Statcast data from Baseball Savant
sc_leader <- statcast_leaderboards(leaderboard = "exit_velocity_barrels",year = 2022)

# Select relevant columns
sc_leader %>% 
  mutate(Name = paste(first_name, last_name),
         `Max Hit Speed` = max_hit_speed,
         `Avg Hit Speed` = avg_hit_speed,
         `Barrels` = barrels,
         `Barrel Percent` = brl_percent) %>%
  select(Name,`Max Hit Speed`,`Avg Hit Speed`,`Barrels`,`Barrel Percent`) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Max Hit Speed`)) %>% slice(1:10) %>% kable(booktabs=T)

## Data Scraping

Acquiring data from internet websites can be completed by using data scraping methods. In essence, this allows your computer to extract data from websites. There are a handful of techniques that we will use to accomplish some basic scraping tasks.

### General Tips

1. *Brainstorm*: Ask yourself what data you need and were to find it. If you pull from different sources, do you have a unique identifier between the sources?

2. *Start small*: View your scraping project as a war, winning it with small battles. If you want to scrape sports statistics for the NFL, consider how to scrape these statistics for one team.

3. *Hyperlinks are your friend*: Lead to websites with more detailed information and/or serve as the unique identifier between different data sources?

4. *Data is everywhere*: Text color, font, or highlighting may serve as valuable data that you need. If these features exist on the webpage, then they exist within the HTML code which generated the document.

5. *Ready your search engine*: When you are undoubtably stuck and have a question, it’s likely the answer is already on
[StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/)](https://stackoverflow.com/)

6. *Careful how quickly you scrape from a website*: If you attempt to scrape from a website too frequently, you may get a temporary (or even permanent) IP ban. You can view a website's rules for scraping by looking at the `robots.txt` file on the website of interest. For example, see: [https://www.basketball-reference.com/robots.txt](https://www.basketball-reference.com/robots.txt)

### Introduction to HTML

All contents that are displayed on a web page are structured through HTML with the help of HTML
elements. HTML elements consist of a tag and contents. The tag defines how the web browser should format and display the content. 

Aptly, the content is what should be displayed.

Attributes are optional parameters which provide additional information about the element in which the attribute is included. The type of attribute is the attribute name , whereas the quantity assigned to the attribute is the attribute value.

![HTML element structure](images/html.png){width=80%}

\newpage

### rvest Package

The `rvest` (pronounced "harvest") package in R is one of the best options for scraping data directly into R.

This is part of the tidyverse ecosystem in R. Allows users to scrape (or harvest) data from webpages.

Common use functions from the package include: \
- read_html(): read HTML from a webpage \
- html_elements(): returns a subset of elements with specified characteristics \
- html_text(): returns the content of all elements \
- html_attr(): returns attribute values for all elements with specified attribute \
- html_table(): returns a list of all HTML tables

A working knowledge of css and/or xpath is helpful.

### CSS Gadget Selector

All web pages are composed of HTML elements, but some elements are incredibly complex. They often are
nested inside of other elements or rely on other elements from another document.

A selector gadget allows you to determine what css selector you need to extract the information you desire. These JavaScript bookmark lets determine where the information you desire belongs in the HTML code.

You can download the most popular selector gadget here which also has a [Google Chrome extension available (shorturl.at/nrFJP)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=en).

Probably more than half the time, these gadgets prove less than helpful which is why I suggest perusing the HTML file on your own with the Inspect feature in Google Chrome.

\newpage

### Scraping Examples

Many R packages exist to scrape data from the Sports Reference websites, however, we can also scrape the data ourselves without too much trouble.

```{r wilson-scrape2}
# Grab the node of interest and format the output as a html_table(). 
# This is now a list
