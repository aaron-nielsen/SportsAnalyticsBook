Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

However, in practice I always find myself copying an existing, working book and modifying it instead of starting from scratch. So this tutorial is going to have you do that as well, using this book as the one you copy from. [more setup here] You will have to name your book’s repository. To differentiate your book’s repo name from this “bookdown-tutorial” repo, here we’ll call your book “awesome-book” but you should consistently name it what you want to name it. 26.1 Get “bookdown-tutorial” going on your local computer Go to https://github.com/jules32/bookdown-tutorial Click the green “clone or download” button and DOWNLOAD ZIP. Locally on your computer, unzip the folder, save it in a reasonable place Rename 2 things from “bookdown-tutorial” to “awesome-book”. You can do this in the finder/windows explorer: the folder itself (that you just unzipped) the .Rproj file Double-click the .Rproj file to launch RStudio Install packages and restart install.packages(\"bookdown\") install.packages(\"usethis\") Use the menu item Session &gt; Restart R Click on the Build tab in the top right pane Click on Build Book! Nice job! Now let’s make it yours, and connect it to GitHub. 26.2 Create your “awesome-book” GitHub repo Go to your GitHub account: github.com/username Click on Repositories, and the green button “New” to create a new repo Name this new repo “awesome-book” DO NOT initialize this repo with a README Click the green “create repository” button — this will take you to your new repo Click the tiny “clone or download” button near the top and COPY URL 26.3 Turn “bookdown-tutorial” into “awesome-book” The following is from Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git With R Go back to RStudio, to your “awesome-book” project In the Console, type usethis::use_git() and say Yes to the two prompts. This will restart R and give you a new Git tab in the upper right pane. Now, click on the Terminal tab next to the Console tab. Type git remote add origin &lt;paste your copied awesome-book github url here&gt; Type git push --set-upstream origin master 26.4 Publish “awesome-book” Last steps! Go back to github.com/username/“awesome-book” and refresh — our files should be there! But we want it to be a book published as https://username.github.io/awesome-book. Click Settings Scroll down to GitHub Settings Change the Source pulldown from “None” to “master branch /docs folder” It should say “Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/awesome-book/” — click the link to see! Now, you’re set — you just need to write your book. 26.5 Moving forward As you write your .Rmd files, build the book and commit all files, including the docs/ folder, and your published book will be updated!
