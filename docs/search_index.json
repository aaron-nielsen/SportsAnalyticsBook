To begin using R Studio, you will need to install “R” first and then install “R Studio” on your computer. Step 1: Download R (a) Visit https://www.r-project.org/ (b) Click CRAN under Download (c) Select any of the mirrors (d) Click the appropriate link for your type of system (Mac, Windows, Linux) (e) Download R on this next page. (For Windows, this will say install R for the first time. For Mac, this will be under Latest release and will be something like R-4.1.0.pkg – the numbers may differ depending on the most recent version) (f) Install R on your computer Step 2: Download R Studio (a) Visit https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (b) Click to download (c) Install R Studio on your computer Step 3: Verify R Studio is working (a) Open R Studio (b) Let’s enter a small dataset and calculate the average to make sure everything is working correctly. (c) In the console, type in the following dataset of Sammy Sosa’s season home run totals from 1998–2002: sosa.HR &lt;- c(66,63,50,64,49) In the console, calculate the average season home run total for Sammy Sosa between 1998–2002: mean(sosa.HR) ## [1] 58.4 (e) Did you find Slammin’ Sammy’s average home run total was 58.4? If so, you should be set up correctly! 1.2 Getting Started With R For the following examples, let’s consider Peyton Manning’s career with the Denver Broncos. In his four seasons with the Broncos, Manning’s passing yard totals were: 4659, 5477, 4727, 2249. Let’s enter this data into R. To enter a vector of data, use the c() function. peyton &lt;- c(4659, 5477, 4727, 2249) To look at the data you just put in the variable peyton, type peyton into the console and press enter. peyton ## [1] 4659 5477 4727 2249 Some basic function for calculating summary statistics include mean(), median(), var(), and sd(). mean(peyton) ## [1] 4278 median(peyton) ## [1] 4693 var(peyton) ## [1] 1967068 sd(peyton) ## [1] 1402.522 R allows you to install additional packages (or functions) that aren’t offered in the base version of R. To install a package, use install.packages() and to load a package, use library(). One package that we will use frequently is tidyverse. This package includes several other packages and functions such as ggplot (plotting function), dplyr (data manipulation package), and stringr (string manipulation package). install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) 1.3 Definitions Definition 1.1 A population is a well-defined complete collection of objects. Definition 1.2 A sample is a subset of the population. Example 1.1 Suppose we are interested in studying Peyton’s Manning’s season passing yards totals. What would be the population and what is one possible sample? Example 1.2 Suppose we are interested in studying Peyton’s Manning’s season passing yards totals. What would be the population and what is one possible sample? Definition 1.3 Quantitative data is numeric data or numbers. It can be broken into two further categories: discrete and continuous data. Definition 1.4 Discrete data is quantitative data with a finite or countably infinite number of values. Definition 1.5 Continuous data is quantitative data with an uncountably infinite number of values or data taken from an interval. Example 1.3 What are possible discrete and continuous data associated with Peyton Manning? Definition 1.6 Qualitative data refers to names, categories, or descriptions. It can also be broken down into two further categories, nominal data and ordinal data. Definition 1.7 Nominal data is qualitative data with no natural ordering. Definition 1.8 Ordinal data is qualitative data with a natural ordering. Example 1.4 What are possible nominal and ordinal data associated with Peyton Manning? 1.4 Descriptive Statistics While we will learn about some descriptive statistics that are unique to specific sports, there are some descriptive statistics that are frequently used in many applications. To begin, let \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) represent a sample of size \\(n\\), where \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i^\\text{th}\\) value in the dataset. Definition 1.9 The sum of the data values is given by: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n\\) Definition 1.10 The sample mean of the dataset is given by \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) Example 1.5 Recall that Peyton Manning’s season passing yards total while with the Broncos were: 4659, 5477, 4727, 2249. Calculate the sample mean of these values.

How did these players turn out? Find the WAR for each of the players in their pre-free agency years and compare it against the Rockies draft picks in the same rounds from the same draft. 23.2.2 Future Value Future Value, Chapter 7, How to Scout (Longenhagen and McDaniel 2020) If a player receives a running grade of 40, approximately what proportion of MLB players have a lower have a lower running grade? For a given tool, about 95% of all player grades fall between what two bounds?
