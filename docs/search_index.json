To begin using R Studio, you will need to install “R” first and then install “R Studio” on your computer. Step 1: Download R (a) Visit https://www.r-project.org/ (b) Click CRAN under Download (c) Select any of the mirrors (d) Click the appropriate link for your type of system (Mac, Windows, Linux) (e) Download R on this next page. (For Windows, this will say install R for the first time. For Mac, this will be under Latest release and will be something like R-4.1.0.pkg – the numbers may differ depending on the most recent version) (f) Install R on your computer Step 2: Download R Studio (a) Visit https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (b) Click to download (c) Install R Studio on your computer Step 3: Verify R Studio is working (a) Open R Studio (b) Let’s enter a small dataset and calculate the average to make sure everything is working correctly. (c) In the console, type in the following dataset of Sammy Sosa’s season home run totals from 1998–2002: sosa.HR &lt;- c(66,63,50,64,49) In the console, calculate the average season home run total for Sammy Sosa between 1998–2002: mean(sosa.HR) ## [1] 58.4 (e) Did you find Slammin’ Sammy’s average home run total from 1998–2002 was 58.4? If so, you should be set up correctly! 1.1.2 Some R Basics For the following examples, let’s consider Peyton Manning’s career with the Denver Broncos. In his four seasons with the Broncos, Manning’s passing yard totals were: 4659, 5477, 4727, 2249. Let’s enter this data into R. To enter a vector of data, use the c() function. peyton &lt;- c(4659, 5477, 4727, 2249) To look at the data you just put in the variable peyton, type peyton into the console and press enter. peyton ## [1] 4659 5477 4727 2249 Some basic function for calculating summary statistics include summary, mean(), median(), var(), and sd(). summary(peyton) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 2249 4056 4693 4278 4914 5477 mean(peyton) ## [1] 4278 sd(peyton) ## [1] 1402.522 R allows you to install additional packages (collections of functions) that aren’t offered in the base version of R. To install a package, use install.packages() and to load a package, use library(). One package that we will use frequently is tidyverse. This package includes several other packages and functions such as ggplot (plotting function), dplyr (data manipulation package), and stringr (string manipulation package). install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) You will also need to know how to load datasets from files. For this class, we will typically provide data files is .csv format. Here is how to load a file: # load readr package and load example dataset NFL_2021_Team_Passing &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/NFL_2021_Team_Passing.csv&quot;) # we can look at the header (first few entries) using &quot;head()&quot; head(NFL_2021_Team_Passing) ## # A tibble: 6 × 25 ## Rk Tm G Cmp Att `Cmp%` Yds TD `TD%` Int `Int%` Lng ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 Tampa Bay… 17 492 731 67.3 5229 43 5.9 12 1.6 62 ## 2 2 Los Angel… 17 443 674 65.7 4800 38 5.6 15 2.2 72 ## 3 3 Dallas Co… 17 444 647 68.6 4800 40 6.2 11 1.7 73 ## 4 4 Kansas Ci… 17 448 675 66.4 4791 37 5.5 13 1.9 75 ## 5 5 Los Angel… 17 406 607 66.9 4642 41 6.8 18 3 79 ## 6 6 Las Vegas… 17 429 628 68.3 4567 23 3.7 14 2.2 61 ## # … with 13 more variables: `Y/A` &lt;dbl&gt;, `AY/A` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Y/C` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `Y/G` &lt;dbl&gt;, Rate &lt;dbl&gt;, Sk &lt;dbl&gt;, SKYds &lt;dbl&gt;, `Sk%` &lt;dbl&gt;, `NY/A` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `ANY/A` &lt;dbl&gt;, `4QC` &lt;dbl&gt;, GWD &lt;dbl&gt;, EXP &lt;dbl&gt; 1.2 Which Sports? Which sports will we be analyzing in this class? 1.3 Challenges What kind of challenges could we encounter dealing with sports data? 1.4 Cautionary Notes What should we be careful of when analyzing sports data? 1.5 Ethical Concerns What kinds of ethical concerns should we consider when dealing with sports data?
