#### WAR comparison (Prob)
Link to WAR explaination: https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/wins-above-replacement

Player X has a projected mean WAR of 3 with standard deviation of 2 and player Y has a projected mean WAR of 1.5 with a standard deviation of 3. Assume projected WAR is normally distributed.
Q: What is the probability that Player X outperforms Player Y?
A: 
We want Pr(X>Y) or Pr(X-Y>0).  
Let Z = X-Y.  
E[Z]=1.5
Var(Z)=5
Pr(Z>0)=1-Pr(Z $\leq$ 0)
```{r}
#Calculate probability Z<=0
pr <- pnorm(0,1.5,sqrt(5))
print(1-pr)
```
The Probability that Player X outperforms Player Y is 0.7488. 



#### Injured Baserunner (Prob)
A runner on first base with 2 out and nobody else on base will attempt to steal second base on the first pitch 70% of the time if he is fully healthy but only 10% of the time if he is playing through an injury. Assume that 80% of the player population is healthy. You see a randomly selected runner not attempt a steal in this situation. 
Q: What is the probability that the runner is playing through an injury?
A: 
From Bayes Theorem:  

Pr(Injury given No Steal) = Pr(No Steal given Injury)\*Pr(Injury)/P(No Steal).  

Pr(No Steal given Injury) = 1 - Pr(Steal given Injury) = 0.9.  

Pr(Injury) = 1- Pr(Healthy) = 0.2.  

Pr(No Steal) = Pr(No Steal given Injury)\*Pr(Injury)+Pr(No Steal given Healthy)\*Pr(Healthy).  

Pr(No Steal) = 0.9\*0.2+0.7\*0.8 = 0.74.  

Therefore Pr(Injury given No Steal) = 0.9\*0.2/0.74 = 0.243.  


#### OPS (EDA)
Q: Using the dataset, plot the leagues average OPS from every year in the data to see the progression.
A:
```{r}
mlb = read.csv('~/Google Drive/My Drive/Sports Analytics/SportsAnalyticsBook/data/mlb_team_stats_history.csv')
head(mlb)

# make new variables
mlb=mutate(mlb,SLG=(X1B+2*X2B+3*X3B+4*HR)/(AB))
mlb=mutate(mlb,OBP=(H+BB+HBP)/(AB+BB+HBP+SF))
mlb=mutate(mlb,OPS=OBP+SLG)

# get avg ops
summarize(mlb, Average = mean(OPS,na.rm=T))

# get avg ops by year
group_by(mlb, yearID)%>%
summarize(Average = mean(OPS, na.rm=T))

group_by(mlb, yearID)%>%
summarize(Average = mean(OPS, na.rm=T))%>%View

#create new dataset
mlbYr=group_by(mlb, yearID)%>%
summarize(Average = mean(OPS, na.rm=T))

#plot it
ggplot(mlbYr, aes(x=yearID, y= Average))+geom_point()
```
Followup Q: What would cause the data to peak around the year 2000?
A: PED's

#### Probability of Winning a Game (Prob)
The formula for the probability of a tennis player winning a game (from Analyzing Wimbledon) is given by
$\frac{p^4*(-8*p^3+28*p^2-34*p+15)}{p^2+(1-p)^2}$ where $p$ is the probability of a player winning their service point.
Q: If a player wins their service points 62% of the time, what is the probability they win the game?
A:
```{r}
p <- 0.62
pr_game <- (p^4*(-8*p^3+28*p^2-34*p+15))/(p^2+(1-p)^2)
pr_game
```


#### Graph Example of Probability of Winning Point vs Probability of Winning Game (Prob)
```{r}
game <- c(0)
pr <- 1:100
for(x in pr) {
  p <- pr/100
  pr_game <- (p^4*(-8*p^3+28*p^2-34*p+15))/(p^2+(1-p)^2)
  game <- c(game,pr_game)
}
game[1]
game <- game[2:101]
game[1]
df <- do.call(rbind, Map(data.frame, point_pr=pr, game_pr=game))
ggplot(df, aes(x=point_pr, y=game_pr)) +
  geom_point()+xlab('Probability of Winning a Service Point')+ylab('Probability of Winning a Game')
```


### WNBA Scores (EDA)
Q: What is the difference in PPG for a winning team at home vs a winning team away?
A:
```{r}
wnba=read.csv('~/Google Drive/My Drive/Sports Analytics/SportsAnalyticsBook/data/WNBA_Games2019_Scores.csv')
head(wnba)

group_by(wnba, Winner)%>%
  summarize(Count=n())%>%
  mutate(Percent=Count/sum(Count))

group_by(wnba, Winner)%>%
  summarize(Average=mean(PTSwin,na.rm=T),sd=sd(PTSwin,na.rm=T))

84.822-83.787
```
A home team winner scores on average 1.035 PPG more than an away team winner.
